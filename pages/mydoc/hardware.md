```
#include "DigiKeyboard.h"

void setup() {
  // Start the keyboard
  DigiKeyboard.delay(2000); // wait for 2 seconds
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(0); // windows key
  DigiKeyboard.delay(1000);
  DigiKeyboard.print("cmd"); // open command prompt
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);
  DigiKeyboard.delay(1000);
  DigiKeyboard.print("echo Hello World!"); // type command
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);
  DigiKeyboard.delay(1000);
  DigiKeyboard.print("exit"); // exit command prompt
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER);
}

void loop() {
}
```

Upload the script to the Digispark by clicking the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE.

#### 125kHz RFID


Materials:

-	Arduino Uno or compatible board
-	MFRC522 RFID reader module
-	RFID tags/cards
-	Breadboard
-	Jumper wires

Circuit Diagram:

1. Connect the RFID reader module to the Arduino board using jumper wires. The connections are as follows:

-	RFID module SDA pin to Arduino digital pin 10
-	RFID module SCK pin to Arduino digital pin 13
-	RFID module MOSI pin to Arduino digital pin 11
-	RFID module MISO pin to Arduino digital pin 12
-	RFID module VCC pin to Arduino 5V pin
-	RFID module GND pin to Arduino GND pin

2. Connect the RFID tag antenna to the RFID reader module. The antenna can either be a coil of wire or an actual RFID tag.

3. Upload the RFID library to the Arduino board. You can find the library and instructions on how to install it on the Arduino website.

4. Write the code to read the RFID tag data. Here is an example code that will read the tag data and display it on the serial monitor:


```
#include <SPI.h>
#include <MFRC522.h>

#define SS_PIN 10
#define RST_PIN 9

MFRC522 rfid(SS_PIN, RST_PIN); // Create instance of the RFID reader module

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // Initialize serial communication
  SPI.begin(); // Initialize SPI communication
  rfid.PCD_Init(); // Initialize RFID reader module
}

void loop() {
  if (rfid.PICC_IsNewCardPresent() && rfid.PICC_ReadCardSerial()) { // Check if a new RFID tag is present
    Serial.print("Tag UID: ");
    for (byte i = 0; i < rfid.uid.size; i++) { // Loop through the tag data and display it on the serial monitor
      Serial.print(rfid.uid.uidByte[i] < 0x10 ? "0" : "");
      Serial.print(rfid.uid.uidByte[i], HEX);
    }
    Serial.println();
    rfid.PICC_HaltA(); // Halt the tag and prepare to read a new one
  }
}
```

Test the system by holding an RFID tag near the reader antenna. The tag data should be displayed on the serial monitor.



#### NFC

##### PN532

Materials:

-	Arduino Uno or compatible board
-	PN532 NFC/RFID reader and writer module
-	Breadboard
-	Jumper wires
-	USB cable


Here are the steps to create an NFC reader and writer with Arduino:


Step 1: Connect the PN532 NFC/RFID module to the Arduino board.

Connect the PN532 module to the Arduino board using the following pins:


-	VCC to 5V
-	GND to GND
-	SDA to Digital Pin 10
-	SCK to Digital Pin 13
-	MOSI to Digital Pin 11
-	MISO to Digital Pin 12
-	IRQ to Digital Pin 2

Step 2: Connect the Arduino board to your computer.

Connect the Arduino board to your computer using the USB cable.


Step 3: Install the necessary libraries.

You will need to install the Adafruit PN532 library to interface with the PN532 module. Open the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries, search for "PN532" and install the Adafruit PN532 library.

Step 4: Upload the code to the Arduino board.

Copy and paste the following code into the Arduino IDE:

```
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_PN532.h>

// Create an instance of the PN532 class
Adafruit_PN532 nfc(PN532_SCK, PN532_MISO, PN532_MOSI, PN532_SS);

void setup(void) {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Initialize the PN532 module
  nfc.begin();

  // Configure the module as an NFC reader
  nfc.SAMConfig();
}

void loop(void) {
  uint8_t success;
  uint8_t uid[] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
  uint8_t uidLength;

  // Wait for an NFC tag to be detected
  success = nfc.readPassiveTargetID(PN532_MIFARE_ISO14443A, uid, &uidLength);

  // If an NFC tag is detected, print its UID
  if (success) {
    Serial.print("UID: ");
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < uidLength; i++) {
      Serial.print(uid[i], HEX);
    }
    Serial.println("");
  }
}
```

This code sets up the PN532 module as an NFC reader and prints the UID of any detected NFC tag.

Upload the code to the Arduino board by clicking on the Upload button.

Step 5: Test the NFC reader.


Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE and hold an NFC tag near the PN532 module. The UID of the tag should be printed in the Serial Monitor.

Step 6: Write data to an NFC tag.

To write data to an NFC tag, you will need to modify the code from Step 4. Here is an example code that writes a text message to an NFC tag:


```
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_PN532.h>

Adafruit_PN532 nfc(PN532_SCK, PN532_MISO, PN532_MOSI, PN532_SS);

void setup(void) {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial) delay(10); // for Leonardo/Micro/Zero

  nfc.begin();

  uint32_t versiondata = nfc.getFirmwareVersion();
  if (!versiondata) {
    Serial.print("PN53x not found");
    while (1); // halt
  }
  Serial.print("Found chip PN5"); Serial.println((versiondata>>24) & 0xFF, HEX); 
  Serial.print("Firmware ver. "); Serial.print((versiondata>>16) & 0xFF, DEC); 
  Serial.print('.'); Serial.println((versiondata>>8) & 0xFF, DEC);
  
  nfc.setPassiveActivationRetries(0xFF);

  nfc.SAMConfig();
}

void loop(void) {
  uint8_t success;
  uint8_t uid[] = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }; // Buffer to store the returned UID
  uint8_t uidLength;                        // Length of the UID (4 or 7 bytes depending on ISO14443A card type)
  
  // Wait for an ISO14443A type card (Mifare, etc.). When one is found, 'uid' will be populated with the UID.
  success = nfc.readPassiveTargetID(PN532_MIFARE_ISO14443A, &uid[0], &uidLength);

  if (success) {
    Serial.println("Found an ISO14443A card");
    Serial.print("UID Length: ");Serial.print(uidLength, DEC);Serial.println(" bytes");
    Serial.print("UID Value: ");
    for (uint8_t i=0; i < uidLength; i++) {
      Serial.print(" 0x");Serial.print(uid[i], HEX);
    }
    Serial.println("");
    
    uint8_t data[] = { 0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67 };  // Data to write to the tag
    uint8_t dataLength = sizeof(data);
    }
 }
```

#### Infrared Transmitter


##### TSOP38238


1. Get an Arduino board and an IR receiver module, such as the TSOP38238. The datasheet for the TSOP38238 can be found online, which provides detailed information on how to connect the module to an Arduino board and how to read IR signals.


2. Connect the IR receiver module to your Arduino board, following the pinout provided in the datasheet.


3. Download and install the IRremote library for Arduino, which provides a convenient interface for working with IR signals.

4. Use the IRremote library to read incoming IR signals from a remote control. You can use the example code provided with the library as a starting point and modify it to fit your needs.

5. Once you have successfully read IR signals from a remote control, you can use this information to control other devices that use IR signals, such as TVs, DVD players, and air conditioners.

```
#include <IRremote.h>

int receiver_pin = 11;
IRrecv irrecv(receiver_pin);
decode_results results;

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  irrecv.enableIRIn();
}

void loop()
{
  if (irrecv.decode(&results))
  {
    Serial.println(results.value, HEX);
    irrecv.resume(); // Receive the next value
  }
}
```

This code sets up an IR receiver module connected to pin 11 of the Arduino board. The code uses the IRremote library to receive and decode incoming IR signals from a remote control. The decoded signal is printed to the serial monitor in hexadecimal format.
